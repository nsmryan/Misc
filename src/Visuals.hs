After a run, if diagrams are enabled then read the log files generated somehow
and produce diagrams from them.

This should include:

average and best fitness (possible all fitnesses as well)

diversity chart/heatmap according to moment metric

sequence of visuals layed on top of each other
  bits -> black/white
  numbers -> color
  real -> grayscale
 
heatmap of frequency of possible values at each position
  each column is value, row is gen, color is freq in best individual

grayscale image of freq at position of bits

map of number of 1s like the UGA stuff
